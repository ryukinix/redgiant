calculates statistics like avg, min, max, std temperature and show it
as a TUI dashboard based in [Textual] technology.

# How to use

... WIP.

# Motivation

I have a computer with overheating problem. I don't know yet the
proper max temperature where something fails, neither if the faults is
the CPU heating or GPU. No previous project was good enough for me, so
I'm creating this.

The name **redgiant** refers to the massive red stars that will blow-up in
soon (a few million years from now).
